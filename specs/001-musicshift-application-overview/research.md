# Research: MusicShift Application

This document outlines the research conducted to resolve ambiguities in the feature specification.

## Track Matching Strategy

**Decision**: A multi-step matching strategy will be implemented.

**Rationale**: To maximize accuracy, the system will first attempt to match tracks using the most precise identifiers available. If that fails, it will fall back to metadata-based searching.

**Implementation Steps**:
1.  **ISRC/UPC Matching**: If the source platform (Spotify) provides an ISRC (International Standard Recording Code) or UPC (Universal Product Code) for a track, the system will use this to search for an exact match on the destination platform (YouTube Music).
2.  **Metadata Matching**: If ISRC/UPC matching fails or is not available, the system will perform a search on the destination platform using the track's metadata: a combination of track title, artist name, and album name.
3.  **Fuzzy Matching (Future Consideration)**: For a future release, a fuzzy matching algorithm could be implemented to handle slight variations in track titles or artist names.

**Alternatives considered**: A simpler, metadata-only approach was considered but rejected in favor of a more robust strategy that prioritizes accuracy.

## Matching Accuracy Thresholds

**Decision**: The system will not use a configurable numerical threshold for matching accuracy in the MVP. Instead, it will rely on the multi-step matching strategy to provide the best possible match.

**Rationale**: A user-configurable threshold for matching accuracy can be confusing and may lead to unexpected results. The primary goal is to find the *correct* track, not a *similar* one. The multi-step approach is a more reliable way to achieve this.

**Error Handling**: If a track cannot be matched with high confidence, it will be flagged as a failed transfer in the completion summary. The user will be able to see which tracks failed and for what reason.

**Future Consideration**: In a future release, a more advanced matching configuration could be introduced, allowing users to choose between different matching strategies (e.g., "Strict" vs. "Best Effort") or to manually resolve ambiguous matches.
