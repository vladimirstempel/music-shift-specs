# Feature Specification: MusicShift Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-musicshift-application-overview`  
**Created**: Friday, September 12, 2025
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "## MusicShift Application Overview Based on the documents, MusicShift is a web application designed to transfer users' music libraries (playlists, tracks, albums, artists) between Spotify and YouTube Music, utilizing their respective APIs (`@spotify/web-api-ts-sdk` and `libmuse`). It's being developed using Angular (v20-21), TypeScript, RxJS, NgRx (signal store), Angular Material with a focus on an extensible architecture and modern web development practices. ## Project Requirements ### Functional Requirements: * **Authentication:** User can register with email + password or via Google. * **Authentication (Connect services):** Users must be able to authenticate with both Spotify and YouTube Music services. The design includes dedicated platform authentication buttons and potentially email login options. * **Content Selection:** Users need to select the specific content (playlists, albums, artists, tracks) they wish to transfer from the source platform. Filtering and search capabilities for content selection are required. * **Music Library Transfer:** The core functionality is transferring the selected music library data between Spotify and YouTube Music. * **Track Matching & Normalization:** The application must map and normalize track metadata between the different platform formats. Design documents mention options for track matching accuracy and handling failed matches. * **Transfer Configuration:** Users should be able to configure transfer options, such as maintaining playlist organization, handling private playlists, skipping already transferred tracks, and setting matching accuracy/thresholds. * **Transfer Progress Monitoring:** Users need to see the real-time progress of the transfer, including overall status, per-item status (playlist/track), estimated time remaining, and any potential issues or errors. * **Transfer History:** The application should maintain a history of past transfers, allowing users to view details, status, and potentially retry or delete history entries. * **Completion Summary:** Upon completion, users should see a summary report including success rates, failed items, time taken, and options to view results or download a report. ### Non-Functional Requirements: * **Architecture:** Must follow Object-Oriented Design, SOLID principles, Service Pattern, and Adapter Pattern. A Repository Pattern is considered for the future. * **Extensibility:** Designed to allow future support for additional music platforms via adapter classes. * **Code Quality:** Concise TypeScript with proper typing, functional programming patterns, immutability, pure functions, and descriptive naming conventions are required. * **Performance:** Utilize Angular's OnPush change detection, Signals API, lazy loading, `trackBy`, and virtual scrolling for optimal performance. * **UI/UX:** Adhere to the specified Design System (colors, typography, spacing, etc.), provide a clear, easy-to-use interface, ensure reliability during transfer, and follow mobile-first responsive design principles. * **Testing:** Implement unit tests (Jest), component tests (TestBed), and HTTP mocks (HttpTestingController). * **Build & Deployment:** Use Angular CLI. Support environment-specific configuration and potentially SSR with Angular Universal. * **Accessibility:** Meet WCAG AA standards for color contrast, ensure full keyboard navigation, provide screen reader support (ARIA labels, semantic HTML), and consider touch targets."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a music enthusiast, I want to transfer my music library from one streaming service to another, so that I can switch platforms without losing my curated playlists and saved music.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has authenticated with both Spotify and YouTube Music, **When** they select a playlist to transfer, **Then** the system should create a matching playlist on the destination platform with the corresponding tracks.
2. **Given** a transfer is in progress, **When** the user navigates to the progress monitoring page, **Then** they should see the real-time status of the transfer.
3. **Given** a transfer has completed, **When** the user views the completion summary, **Then** they should see a report of successful and failed transfers.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a track from the source playlist cannot be found on the destination platform?
- How does the system handle API rate limits from the music services?
- What happens if the user's connection is interrupted during a transfer?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to register with an email and password or via Google.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to authenticate with their Spotify and YouTube Music accounts.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to select playlists, albums, artists, and tracks to transfer.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide filtering and search capabilities for content selection.
